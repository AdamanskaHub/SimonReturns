TitleOne: The Vision
ParaOne: >-
  "Meditating" is a mental workout that's accessible to all of us. It even comes
  to us naturally - for example when we contemplate a beautiful view, or get
  lost into a piece of music. Let's demystify this exercise together! I'd like
  to help you discover the simplest and more accessible forms for you through
  playful, easy discoveries. 
TitleTwo: Who Am I?
ParaTwo: >-
  I've always been people-driven - that's what drove me to a career in sales. I
  understood what I deep down, what I liked about it was transmission of
  knowledge. What better competence to teach than an Ã¼ber-skill that takes your
  life to the next level?
TitleThree: The Benefits

ParaThree: >-
  From rejuvenating the brain to more happiness, the science is coming with ever
  more evidence of the positive benefits of some form of daily meditative
  exercise. For links to articles, research and testimonials, take a look at the
  blog.
